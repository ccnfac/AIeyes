## 🚀 Why AI Eyes?

AIeyes transforms your field of vision into a smart sensor network—blending night vision, radar, thermal detection, and augmented situational overlays into a single rugged device. Whether monitoring a school hallway or securing a battlefield rooftop, AIeyes enables edge-native threat recognition with instant MyNetwerk CamGrid access.

The future is edge-native. AI Eyes enables **localized, attritable intelligence** with **real-time, privacy-respecting inference**. Whether for **city-wide surveillance** or **public safety**, this is **AI where you need it**—**not in the cloud**.
